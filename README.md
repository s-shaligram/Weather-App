Weather App

The Weather App is a mobile application developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. It allows users to check the current weather information for different locations. The app is built following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and utilizes Coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks. Gradle is used as the build system to manage dependencies and build the app. The app can be run on an Android Emulator for testing and development purposes.

Introduction

The Weather App provides users with up-to-date weather information for different locations. It follows the MVVM architecture, separating the business logic (ViewModel) from the UI (View) and data handling (Model). Coroutines are used for managing background tasks, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The app is built using Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development, and can be easily extended and customized.
